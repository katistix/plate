# üçΩÔ∏è Plate

**A deliciously simple TUI for managing your local development databases.**

Stop messing with complex `docker-compose` files for simple projects. Plate reads a dead-simple `plate.config.json` and spins up persistent, manageable database containers for you, all wrapped in a beautiful and intuitive terminal interface.

* **Persistent Data:** Your data survives between sessions. Close the app and your database state is saved for the next run.
* **Interactive TUI:** A beautiful and responsive terminal interface built with Bubble Tea.
* **Full Lifecycle Management:** Boot, stop, reset, and delete services with single key presses.
* **Clipboard Integration:** Copy a service's connection string directly to your clipboard.

## üöÄ Installation

This project is intended to be installed with a working Go environment.

Simply use `go install` to download, compile, and add the `plate` binary to your system path:

```bash
go install github.com/katistix/plate@latest
```

**Note:** For the `plate` command to be available system-wide, ensure that your Go bin directory is in your system's `PATH`. This is typically located at `$HOME/go/bin`. You can add it to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`) like this:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start

1.  **Initialize a config file:** Run the `init` command in your project's root directory.

    ```bash
    plate init
    ```

    This will create a `plate.config.json` file with some sensible defaults.

2.  **Customize your config:** Open `plate.config.json` and edit it to fit your needs. Change versions, ports, or add new services.

    ```json
    {
      "services": [
        {
          "type": "postgres",
          "name": "main-db",
          "version": "14-alpine",
          "port": 5433
        },
        {
          "type": "redis",
          "name": "cache",
          "version": "7",
          "port": 6380
        },
        {
          "type": "mysql",
          "name": "main-db-2",
          "version": "8",
          "port": 3307
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3.  **Launch the TUI:** Simply run `plate`!

    ```bash
    plate
    ```
